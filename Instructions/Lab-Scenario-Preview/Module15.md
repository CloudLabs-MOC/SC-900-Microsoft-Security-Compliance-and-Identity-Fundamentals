# Lab Scenario Preview: Lab-15: Explore the Core eDiscovery workflow

## Lab overview

In this lab you will go through the steps required for setting up Core eDiscovery and then go through the Core eDiscovery workflow, by creating an eDiscovery hold, creating a search query, and then exporting the results of the search. Note: Licensing for Core eDiscovery requires the appropriate organization subscription and per-user licensing. If you arenâ€™t sure which licenses support core eDiscovery, visit Get started with Core eDiscovery.


## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
 
- Access Core eDiscovery or be added as a member of a Core eDiscovery case, a user must be assigned the appropriate permissions. In this task, you as the global admin, will add specific users as members of the eDiscovery Manager role group.

- As an eDiscovery Administrator (ODL admin is an eDiscovery administrator), will create a case to start using Core eDiscovery.

- Now that you have created a Core eDiscovery case, you can begin to work with the case. In this task, you will create an eDiscovery hold for the case for you just created. Specifically, you will crate a hold for the the exchange mailbox belonging to ODL-User.

-  With a hold in place, you will create a search query. Once your search is complete you will go export and download the results for future investigation. Note: Searches associated with a Core eDiscovery case are not listed on the Content search page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. These searches are listed only on the Searches page of the associated Core eDiscovery case.
