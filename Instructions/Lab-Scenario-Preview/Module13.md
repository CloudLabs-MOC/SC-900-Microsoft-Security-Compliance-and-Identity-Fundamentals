# Lab Scenario Preview: Lab-13: Explore sensitivity labels in Microsoft Purview

## Lab overview

In this lab you will explore the capabilities of sensitivity labels. You will go through the settings for existing sensitivity labels that have been created and the corresponding policy to publish the label. Then you will see how to apply a label and the impact of that label, from the perspective of a user.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Explore the capabilities of sensitivity labels

- You will go through the process of applying a label from the perspective of the user (in this case the user is the admin) and view the content marking that is generated by the label.

-  In addition to content marking, the label protection setting was set for encryption. Per the permissions that were configured with this label, members of the finance group can co-author documents with this label applied and users in the Contoso tenant can view (or any document/email with the label applied). In this task you will send this document to an email address to which you have access (ie., a personal email address) and that is NOT part of the WWLxZZZZ.OnMicrosoft.com domain and see what happens when you try to open the attachment. (optional)
