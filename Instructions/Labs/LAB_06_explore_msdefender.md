#### Task 2: In this task you will navigate to Azure Secure score and explore recommendations that can improve your secure score.

> ‚ùó Important: <br>
> Azure Security Center takes time to populate information such as secure score, compliance, recommendations etc. after enabling the services and enrolling the servers to security center. Sometimes, it can take up to 3 hrs. or even more than that for all the tiles on the overview page to update. if it takes more time, attendees can skip the steps of task 2 & proceed with the Task 3 and can come back later and check on this. We are looking at various approaches to optimize this experience for future workshops.

1. From the Microsoft Defender for Cloud overview page, select the **Secure posture** card.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Recommendations**.  (Note that this is equivalent to having selected Active recommendations from the top of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud overview page).

1. Verify,the **All recommendations** tab is selected (underlined).  Note the dashboard view that shows Active recommendations by severity, Resource health, and more.

1. Note that some items show up as unhealthy resources, as depicted by the red bar on the right of the line item.  From the list, select any unhealthy resource.  In the page that opens, you'll see a description, Remediation steps, and affected resources. Exit out this page, by selecting the **X** on top-right corner of the screen.


#### Task 3:  Recall that Security center is offered in two modes: Azure Defender OFF (free) and Azure Defender ON. In this task you discover how to enable and disable Azure Defender.

1. From the Microsoft Defender for Cloud overview page, select the **Environment settings** from the left navigation panel.
1. Select  the **Expand all** box then select the **Subscription--Azure HOL** subscription listed next to the yellow key icon.
