## Task 2: Explore the Cloud app catalog

Cloud Discovery analyzes your traffic logs against the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps cloud app catalog of over 31,000 cloud apps. The apps are ranked and scored based on more than 80 risk factors to provide you with ongoing visibility into cloud use, Shadow IT, and the risk Shadow IT poses to your organization.  In this task, you'll explore the capabilities of the Cloud app catalog.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Cloud app catalog**.

    ![Picture 1](../Images/appcatalog.png)

    >**Note**: The Cloud app catalog enables you to choose apps that fit your organization's security requirements. Admins can do basic filtering of apps as shown on the top of the page, which includes whether the app is sanctioned, unsanctioned, or has no tag, risk score, Compliance risk factor, and security risk factor.  For example, filtering by compliance risk factor lets you search for a specific standards, certification, and compliance that the app may comply with. Examples include HIPAA, ISO 27001, SOC 2, and PCI-DSS.

1. Select **Compliance risk factor** to view the available options.  You can further filter by risk score, by moving the sliders on the risk score on the top of the page. If you moved the slide, be sure to set it so the range is set at 0 to 10.

1. Admins can also search for apps by category.  For example, in the Apps search bar field enter **Microsoft Viva Engage**, then select **Social network**.  Select **Microsoft Viva Engage** for a detailed view.  Hovering your mouse over any topics for a given category will show an information icon that you can select to get more information about that topic.

## Task 3: Explore the Activity log and Files

1. From the left navigation pane, select and explore the **Files** option and note the options to filter data by app, owner, access level, file type, and matched policy. Also, note the option to create a new policy from search and export of the data.

   ![Picture 1](../Images/select-file.png)

   ![Picture 1](../Images/file-1.png)

   >**Note**: On the Files page, if it says For Defender for Cloud Apps to monitor files in your SaaS apps, go to Settings and Enable file monitoring, select **Enable file monitoring**, then select the **check box (1)** for enabling file monitoring, and select **Save (2)**.
     ![Picture 1](../Images/file-2.png)

1. Select **+ New policy from search**.

   >**Note**: how you can create a policy based on a template, select a policy severity & category, create filters for the policy, create alerts, and even send the alerts to Power Automate.

   ![Picture 1](../Images/filesad.png)

1. Select **Cancel** to exit of the policy creation window, then select **Leave page**.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Activity Log**, under **Cloud apps**. Here you get visibility into all the activities from your connected apps.
   
   ![Picture 1](../Images/files-3.png)

1. You may not see any data listed as it can take several hours to perform retroactive scans once audit is enabled and lab tenants may experience longer than normal delays. Note the available filter options and the option to create new a policy from search.

## Task 4: In this task you will explore the policies and alerts pages in Microsoft Cloud app security

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Policies (1)** under **Cloud apps**, then select **Policy management (2)**.  The listed policies provide information on the number of alerts generated by the policy, severity, etc.

1. Selecting any line item provides more detailed information about the policy. Select an item from the list, i.e. **Risky sign-in**. 

    >**Note**: that you can also create a policy. Select **+ Create policy (3)** to view the types of policies you can create.  Select **Activity policy** to view the different options available for creating the policy.  Select **Cancel** to exit out of the configuration window.
 
     ![Picture 1](../Images/sc900-managepolicy.png)
     
     ![Picture 1](../Images/sc900-activitylog.png)
     
    >**Note**: that you can also have the option to export policy information.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Policy templates (1)**. To create a policy from one the available templates, select the **+ (2)** on the left side of the template line item.  View the different configuration options for the policy.  Select **Cancel** to exit out of the page.
