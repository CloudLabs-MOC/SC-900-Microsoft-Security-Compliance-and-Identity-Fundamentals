# Lab: Explore identity governance in Azure AD with Privileged Identity management.

## Lab scenario
In this lab, you will explore some the basic functionality of Privileged Identity Management (PIM). PIM does require Azure AD Premium P2.  In this lab, you, as the admin, will configure one of your users, Diego Siciliani, with an Azure AD user administrator role, through Privileged ID management (PIM).   With user admin privileges, Diego will be able to create users and groups manage licenses, and more.  Both the admin and the user, Diego, must be configured for Azure AD Premium P2 licensing.

**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

#### Task 1: In this task you, as the admin, will reset the password for the user Diego Siciliani. This step is needed so you can initially sign in as the user in subsequent tasks.

1. Open Microsoft Edge.  In the address bar enter **portal.azure.com**.

2. Sign in with the credentials provided in the **Enviornment Details** Tab. 
    1. In the Sign in window enter **odl_user_xxxxx@xxxxx.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxx is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab
    1. Enter the admin password which should be provided by your lab hosting provider. Select **Sign in**.
    1. When prompted to stay signed- in, select **Yes**.

3. Select **Azure Active Directory**.  

4. From the left navigation panel select **Users**.
