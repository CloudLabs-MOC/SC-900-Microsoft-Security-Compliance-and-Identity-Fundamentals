# Lab: Explore Microsoft Sentinel 

## Lab scenario
In this lab you will walk through the process of creating an  Microsoft Sentinel instance.  You will also set up the permissions to ensure access to the resources that will get deployed to support  Microsoft Sentinel.  Once this basic setup is done you will walk through the steps for connecting Microsoft Sentinel to your data sources, set up a workbook, and do a brief walk-through of some of key capabilities available in Microsoft Sentinel. 
  

**Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes

#### Task 1:  Create an  Microsoft Sentinel instance.

1. If you are not already signed into the Azure portal, sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com, with the Azure credentials.

1. On **Sign in to Microsoft Azure** blade, you will see a login screen, in that enter the following email/username and then click on **Next**.  
   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.
   * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** search for **Microsoft Sentinel** then select **Microsoft Sentinel** from the search results.  

1. From the Microsoft Sentinel page, select **Create**.

1. From Add Microsoft Sentinel to a workspace, select **+ Create a new workspace**.

1. From the basics tab of the Create Log Analytics workspace, enter the following:
    1. Subscription:  **Select the given subscription**   
    1. Resource group: select **Create New**, then enter the name **SC900-ResourceGroup** then select **OK**.
    1. Name: **SC900-LogAnalytics-workspace**.
    1. Region: **East US** (leave this default)

1. For the Tags, you can leave this blank, then select **Review + Create**.

1. Verify the information you entered then select **Create**.

1. If you don’t see the new workspace listed, select **Refresh**, then select **Add**.

     ![Picture 1](../Images/19-1.png)

1. Once the new workspace is added, the Microsoft Sentinel | News & guides page will display., including that the Microsoft Sentinel free trial is activated. Select **OK**  Note the three steps listed on the Get started page.

1. Keep this page open, as you will use it in the next task.

#### Task 2:  With the Microsoft Sentinel instance created, it is important that users that will have responsibility to support Microsoft Sentinel have the necessary permissions.  This is done by assigning the designated user the required role permissions.  In this task, you'll view the available, built-in Microsoft Sentinel roles.

1. In the blue search box, enter **resource groups** then select **Resource groups** from the search results. 

1. From the Resource groups page, select the resource group that you created with Microsoft Sentinel, **SC900-ResourceGroup**.Working at the resource group level will ensure that any role that is selected will apply to all the resources that are part of the Microsoft Sentinel instance that was created in the previous task.


1. From the SC900-ResourceGroup page, select **Access control (IAM)** from the left navigation panel.

1. From the Access control page, select **View my access**. For the Azure subscription provided to you by the Authorized Lab Hoster, a role has been defined that will give you access to manage all necessary resources, as shown in the description. It is important, however, to understand the available Sentinel specific roles. **Note the current role is Owner.** Close the assignments window by selecting the **X** on the top-right corner of the window.

   ![Picture 2](../Images/7-(1).png)

1. If the the role is not owner then follow the below steps:

     - From the Access control page, select **+Add**, then select **Add role assignment**.
     - The Add role assignment window opens.  In **Assignment type** select **Privileged administrator roles** and click on **Next**.
     - On Add role assignment page, under **Role** tab, select **Owner** click on **Next**.
     - On Add role assignment page, under **Members** tab, click on **+ select members**, on select member blade select your useraccount and click on select.
     - Click on **Review + assign**.
    
    >**NOTE**:  As a best practice you should assign the least privilege required for the role.  As a reference, review permissions in Azure Sentinel:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/roles
   
1. From the access control page, select **View my access** to confirm the owner role has been added, then close the window by select the **X** on the top-right corner of the window.

1. Return to the All services page of Azure, by selecting **All Services** from the top-left corner of the page, above where it says Resource groups.

#### Task 3:  In this task you will walk through the steps involved in setting up a data connector to your instance of Microsoft Sentinel and selecting a built-in workbook templates to allow you to quickly gain insights across your data as soon as you connect a data source. Note: Azure lab subscriptions may experience greater than normal delays in connecting to a data source and/or visualizing data.

1. In the search box, in the blue bar on the top of the page next to where it says Microsoft Azure, enter **Microsoft Sentinel** then select **Microsoft Sentinel** from the search results.

1. From the Microsoft Sentinel page, select the workspace you created with the instance of Microsoft Sentinel, **SC900-LogAnalytics-workspace**.

1. The first step with Microsoft Sentinel is to be able to collect data. From the left navigation panel select **Data connectors**, listed under configuration.

1. From the Data connectors page, scroll down on the main window to view the extensive list of available connectors. In the Search box of the data connectors page, enter **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** then from the list select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.
