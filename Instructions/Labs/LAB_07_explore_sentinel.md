## Task 2: Built-in Microsoft Sentinel roles

With the Microsoft Sentinel instance created, it is important that users that will have responsibility to support Microsoft Sentinel have the necessary permissions.  This is done by assigning the designated user the required role permissions. In this task, you'll view the available, built-in Microsoft Sentinel roles.

1. In the **Search resources, services, and docs** search for **resource groups** then select **Resource groups** from the search results. 

1. From the Resource groups page, select the resource group that you created with Microsoft Sentinel, **SC900-ResourceGroup**.

   >**Note**: Working at the resource group level will ensure that any role that is selected will apply to all the resources that are part of the Microsoft Sentinel instance that was created in the previous task.

   >**Note**:  For the Azure subscription provided to you by the Authorized Lab Hoster, a role has been defined that will give you access to manage all necessary resources as shown in the description. It is important, however, to understand the available Sentinel specific roles. Note the current role is Owner.
       
1. Close the assignments window by selecting the **X** on the top-right corner of the window.
